## My own printf
Many programming languages implement a printf function (print formatted), to display a formatted string. This one, originally from the **C** programming language (If you don't know what we are talking about here is the [man printf(3)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html).

In the following project we were recreating our own printf and only took as a case the most used formats (mentioned in the man).
