# My own printf
Many programming languages implement a printf function (print formatted), to display a formatted string. This one, originally from the **C** programming language (If you don't know what we are talking about here is the [man printf(3)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html).

In the following project we were recreating our own printf and only took as a case the most used formats (mentioned in the man).

## REQUIREMENTS
- Have a text editor 
- Clone repository in your console.
- C language compiler [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/).

## FLOWCHART
This was our [flowchart]() to create _printf.

## HOW TO USE _PRINTF 
If you want to know more about how our function works here is the [man _printf](https://gleaming-particle-89c.notion.site/man-_printf-3-3c76fc87e5bc4d8d882118c8b9200392).
